# Cursor Rules for SvelteKit Project

## Package Manager
- Always use `bun` instead of `npm` or `yarn` for package management and script execution
- Use `bun install`, `bun run <script>`, `bun add <package>`, etc.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: SvelteKit 2.x with Svelte 5
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e)
- **Component Development**: Storybook
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Svelte 5 Conventions
- Use Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`) instead of the Options API
- Prefer runes over reactive statements (`$:`) when possible
- Use `$props()` for component props with proper TypeScript typing
- Use `$state()` for component state
- Use `$derived()` for computed values
- Use `$effect()` for side effects

## Code Style
- Follow Prettier formatting (already configured)
- Use ESLint rules (already configured)
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use async/await over promises when appropriate

## File Organization
- Components in `src/lib/` directory
- Routes in `src/routes/` directory (SvelteKit conventions)
- Stories in `src/stories/` directory
- Tests co-located with components or in `*.spec.ts` files
- E2E tests in `e2e/` directory

## Testing
- Write unit tests with Vitest for components and utilities
- Write e2e tests with Playwright for user flows
- Use `*.spec.ts` naming convention for test files
- Test files should be co-located with source files when possible

## Component Development
- Create Storybook stories for reusable components
- Use Storybook for component development and documentation
- Follow accessibility best practices (a11y addon is configured)

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Use Tailwind CSS v4 syntax and features
- Prefer Tailwind classes over custom CSS when possible
- Use CSS custom properties for theme values when needed

## TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript typing
- Avoid `any` types - use proper types or `unknown`
- Use type inference when types are obvious
- Export types/interfaces when they're used across files

## Git
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format when appropriate

## General Guidelines
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into utility functions
- Use SvelteKit's built-in features (load functions, form actions, etc.)
- Follow SvelteKit routing conventions
- Optimize for performance and accessibility
